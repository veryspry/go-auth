### A Go user authentication API

This is a place for me to work on my Go code skills.

Currently, I'm getting a user authentication system going. It's pretty standard stuff, really. User authentication / login persistance is handled by a JWT authentication header.

I'll continue to add to this as it changes and turns into a real project.
